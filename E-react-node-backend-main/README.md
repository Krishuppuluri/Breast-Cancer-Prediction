# E-REACT-NODE-BACKEND Installation Guide

This document provides step-by-step instructions to install and set up the E-REACT-NODE-BACKEND Node.js backend project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime required to run the project. You can download and install it from the official website: [Node.js Download](https://nodejs.org/)

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to install and set up the E-REACT-NODE-BACKEND project:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/ottawa-ehospital/E-react-node-backend.git
   ```

   Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   Change your current directory to the project's root folder:

   ```bash
   cd E-REACT-NODE-BACKEND
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Install the project dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command will download and install all the required dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.

4. **Database Configuration:**

   Configure your database settings in the project. You will likely need to update the `app/config/db.config.js` file to match your database credentials.

5. **Start the Server:**

   To start the Node.js server, run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the server, and it will be accessible at the specified port (usually port 8080 by default).

6. **Testing the API:**

   You can test the API using tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or by making HTTP requests from your frontend application.

## Additional Information

- **Project Structure:**

  The project structure follows a typical Node.js and Express application layout. Key directories include `app/config` for configuration, `app/controllers` for route handlers, and `app/models` for defining database models.

- **Dependencies:**
